# What is this?
This repo contains the source for problem sets in the c programming language second edition book. 

## How do I compile the c files?
The book uses an old c standard version, so we have use the older version when compiling the c source file. GCC allows us to use older programming language versions and if we use the -std=c90 flag it will use the c90 standard when compiling.
